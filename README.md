# Randome Advice Giver

This is a simple react app which on button click gives a random advice.

## Usage

To use this , simply clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone "repository URL"
cd my-app
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```
npm start
```

The development server should be up and running on `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.
